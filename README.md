Distributed Index Library
===

Master Thesis Project by Bogdan Vancea. The main aim is to provide a Distribution and Parallelization framework for the PH-Tree index. A secondary aim is to keep the implementation as general as possible, to allow an easy plugging of other indexes. 

This version has concurrency disabled. For concurrency please use version 1.0(-SNAPSHOT) and
PhTree5 or so.
